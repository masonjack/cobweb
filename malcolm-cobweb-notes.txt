#+TITLE: Notes for cobweb's design

26/10/2012

* ContentLinkParser
 - The class where the actual content is consumed within cobweb.
   - additional content will be need to worked and made available via
     this class. This class is where the content is made available to
     consumers
 - the result of the all_links method is array of absolute urls
 - Stats are overall information about the crawls in progress

*  CobwebLinks is the class that determines the difference between an internal links and external links

* CobwebCrawler
 - Shared state within the cobwebcrawler is most likely going to cause
   problems down the line. The state is shared between threads, and
   will cause problems overall. We are currently relying on the fact
   of the global interpreter lock to make it simpler to reason about,
   but to scale I'm pretty sure this will cause issues and long
   crawling reliablity issues.

* Cobweb is the logical entry point into the crawler. 
 - Kind of clunky in that the get and head requests are done from within
   this class, and kind of redundant code within the two methods
   that do very broadly the same thing.
 - this could pretty easily be refactored to make the whole thing a
   lot cleaner
